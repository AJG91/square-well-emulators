# square-well-emulators
A repository used to apply emulators to the square well interaction in coordinate space. The scattering portion of this code was used to run tests and generate results for the paper ''Efficient emulators for scattering using eigenvector continuation'' by Furnstahl, Garcia, Millican, and Zhang.
